Description: Uses Smith Waterman algorithm to find the 
    optimal alignment between two sequences.
    It uses two matrices, one containing all the scores,
    the other containing the path for one optimal alignment.
    Since there could be more than one optimal alignment, but
    the score between those should not change, the function reports
    only the first one.
